# https://pkt.net/ website

This is the code of the pkt.net website.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ nvm install 16.20.2
# after installation nvm switches to the freshly installed version
# so next line could be skipped
$ nvm use 16.20.2

#install code's dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

## Notes

This repo is a fork from 'www-pkt-cash' repository from a fork that is lately
maintained by coconut3-dev. We, as ACTIVE community of the project, decided that
we want to continue the ORIGINAL project, since nobody informed us about the
decisions we have been announced by the founders of the PKT project on the
21st of August 2024.

As you can see above, we received the website on an out-of-date state.
Installing the dependencies to work on it, filled my (kaotisk-hund here, hi!)
screen with deprecation messages and end of life notes to them that exceed by
far these dates.

121 vulnerabilities (2 low, 31 moderate, 72 high, 16 critical)

This notes session will be removed when the repository will get updated
packages.

Thank you for your patience.
