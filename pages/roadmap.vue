                <p>The PKT roadmap is an overview of the PKT ecosystem development. It is separated into four phases: Launch, Utility, Scale, and Innovate. Each phase defines an era of focus. This provides a guide for community developers and contributors regarding what tools, functionality and capabilities are integral to each era.</p>
                <p>While the phases of the roadmap are presented in order, contributors are working concurrently across multiple eras. This nonlinear development invites a wide range of community participation. While many projects cannot be developed in sequence, considering certain dependencies, this development style matches the project’s agile, open source ethos.</p>
                <p>As you explore this roadmap, you will see the years of development effort that are represented across each phase. Each milestone is a community achievement. Each accomplishment moves the project towards its mission of decentralizing internet access and getting the next billion people online. Since PKT has no central infrastructure, no company, no foundation, no DAO, and no bank account, this roadmap represents a collective vision that honors the global PKT community’s time, intelligence and gracious contributions.</p>

              descr: "TokenStrike will become PKT’s token issuance protocol, similar to ERC-20 for Ethereum. Conceived as a solution to enable multi-currency ledger functionality within the PKT ecosystem, what makes TokenStrike unique is each token supply is its own blockchain. This ensures that token pairs are horizontally transmutable, but issuance and transaction validation does not congest the network for maximizing scalability. TokenStrike is designed to make it possible to issue tokens and NTFs with near-zero cost. This functionality is required so Edge Points can easily tokenize bandwidth and trade tokens in a decentralized bandwidth trading marketplace (PKT Dex). TokenStrike enables atomic swaps using nominal PKT Lightning Network integration. TokenStrike will empower users to tokenize assets, conduct cross-chain transactions, and unlock new possibilities for DeFi applications. TokenStrike development is currently paused while sourcing a new, reliable development team."

          description: "The Innovate era of PKT is the phase of expanding consumer applications that aim to replace traditional, centralized tools and services. This era is focused on enhancing the network's scalability, interoperability, and capacity for handling high volumes of transactions. It targets various areas including bandwidth markets, decentralized exchanges, content delivery networks, media distribution, social networks, and supply chain efficiencies.",
          description_2: "This period will also see the further emergence of Cloud ISPs, boosting the bandwidth market's dynamism and competitiveness. Users will have the opportunity to lease bandwidth guarantees, enabling internet service without relying on traditional ISPs. Improvements to cjdns compact source routing will enhance network resiliency and optimize the balance between router performance and cost. Additionally, advancements in the PKT Lightning Network will introduce new features into both mobile and desktop wallet technologies, enhancing the speed and throughput of payments.",
          description_3: "Overall, the Innovate era will help PKT become one of the most open, high-performant, and versatile decentralized networks globally. This era aims to strengthen the network's infrastructure and blockchain so free and open internet access and e-commerce is accessible and sustainable worldwide.",
